📌 Overview

Traditional Incident Response (IR) frameworks are increasingly inadequate against the growing scale and complexity of modern cyber threats. TIIROF addresses this critical gap with an AI-Driven Incident Response Optimization Framework (IROF) that integrates cutting-edge technologies such as:
    🧠 Explainable AI (XAI)
    🤖 Generative AI (GenAI)
    📚 Large Language Models (LLMs)
    🌐 Threat Intelligence from OSINT, Dark Web, Telegram
    📊 Graph Analytics (Neo4j)
    🧬 Machine Learning (XGBoost, GNNs)
    🛠️ SOAR Tools (TheHive, Cortex, ELK)

TIIROF transforms threat detection, incident triage, and response automation using intelligent decision-making and transparent explainability.

## ABSTRACT
Traditional Incident Response (IR) frameworks are gradually challenged by the thriving scale and complexity of emerging cyber threats, limiting their effectiveness in timely detection, prioritization, and response. To surpass these limitations, we propose an AI-driven Incident Response Optimization Framework (IROF) that integrates Explainable AI (XAI), Generative AI (GenAI), and Large Language Models (LLMs). IROF leverages threat intelligence, historical attack patterns, and real-time behavioral data to enhance threat detection, incident classification, and automated response actions, with incidents prioritized through rigorous impact and risk assessments. The framework's efficacy is validated using real-world stealer malware datasets sourced from OSINT, dark web forums, and Telegram channels. Its implementation incorporates advanced technologies including machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), knowledge graphs (Neo4j), and SOAR tools such as TheHive, Cortex, and ELK. Key techniques, including graph neural networks (GNNs), LLM summarization, XGBoost classification, and reinforcement learning, are employed to achieve significant improvements in detection accuracy, triage efficiency, and decision explainability.

## Introduction
The escalating involution of cyber threats, ranging from stealer malware to advanced persistent threats, is increasingly exceeding the capabilities of traditional incident response (IR) platforms. Security teams frequently encounter delayed detections, incoherent threat analysis, and manual remediation processes that struggle to keep pace with the speed and scale of contemporary attacks. To right away address these critical limitations, we propose the AI-Driven Incident Response Optimization Framework (IROF). This framework leverages the power of Explainable AI (XAI), Generative AI (GenAI), and Large Language Models (LLMs), combined with diverse threat intelligence feeds (OSINT, dark web, Telegram), graph analytics (Neo4j), advanced machine learning (XGBoost, GNNs), and SOAR tools (TheHive, Cortex), to streamline detection, prioritization, and automated response decisions. This research focuses on enhancing real-time threat detection and classification, automating incident response, and rigorously evaluating the resulting improvements in accuracy, false-positive rates, and response times. The outcome is IROF, a scalable, transparent, and efficient IR solution designed for the realities of modern cybersecurity.
