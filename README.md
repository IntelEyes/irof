## 📌 Overview
Traditional Incident Response (IR) frameworks are increasingly inadequate against the growing scale and complexity of modern cyber threats. TIIROF addresses this critical gap with an AI-Driven Incident Response Optimization Framework (IROF) that integrates cutting-edge technologies such as:
* 🧠 Explainable AI (XAI)
* 🤖 Generative AI (GenAI)
* 📚 Large Language Models (LLMs)
* 🌐 Threat Intelligence from OSINT, Dark Web, Telegram
* 📊 Graph Analytics (Neo4j)
* 🧬 Machine Learning (XGBoost, GNNs)
* 🛠️ SOAR Tools (TheHive, Cortex, ELK)

TIIROF transforms threat detection, incident triage, and response automation using intelligent decision-making and transparent explainability.

## ABSTRACT
The TIIROF framework tackles the core limitations of legacy IR systems by unifying:
   * Real-time behavioral telemetry
   * Historical malware and threat actor patterns
   * Contextual impact & risk-based prioritization

## DESCRIPTION
# Key outcomes:
   * 🚀 Accelerated detection and classification of cyber incidents
   * 📈 Reduced false positives and manual triage workload
   * 🧾 Transparent and explainable response decision-making

Tested on real-world stealer malware datasets from OSINT, dark web marketplaces, and Telegram channels, TIIROF achieves significant improvements in operational performance.

# 🔍 Key Features
   * ✅ Threat Detection using ML models like XGBoost and GNNs
   * ⚙️ Automated Incident Triage via SOAR integration
   * 🧠 LLM-Powered Summarization of incidents and logs
   * 🔍 Explainability with SHAP & graph-based visualizations
   * 🌐 Knowledge Graphs to model threat entities and relationships
   * 📡 Multi-Source Threat Intel (OSINT, dark web, Telegram, etc.)
   * 🎯 Reinforcement Learning for adaptive response optimization
