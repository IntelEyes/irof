IROF: An AI-Driven Framework for Automated Threat Detection, Prioritization &amp; Incident Response Optimization with Explainability

#Introduction
The escalating involution of cyber threats, ranging from stealer malware to advanced persistent threats, is increasingly exceeding the capabilities of traditional incident response (IR) platforms. Security teams frequently encounter delayed detections, incoherent threat analysis, and manual remediation processes that struggle to keep pace with the speed and scale of contemporary attacks. To right away address these critical limitations, we propose the AI-Driven Incident Response Optimization Framework (IROF). This framework leverages the power of Explainable AI (XAI), Generative AI (GenAI), and Large Language Models (LLMs), combined with diverse threat intelligence feeds (OSINT, dark web, Telegram), graph analytics (Neo4j), advanced machine learning (XGBoost, GNNs), and SOAR tools (TheHive, Cortex), to streamline detection, prioritization, and automated response decisions. This research focuses on enhancing real-time threat detection and classification, automating incident response, and rigorously evaluating the resulting improvements in accuracy, false-positive rates, and response times. The outcome is IROF, a scalable, transparent, and efficient IR solution designed for the realities of modern cybersecurity.
